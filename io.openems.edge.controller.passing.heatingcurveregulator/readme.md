This is the Consolinno weather dependent heating controller. 
 * It takes the outside temperature as input and asks for the heating to be turned on or off based on the outside temperature. 
 * If the outside temperature is below the activation threshold, a heating temperature is calculated based on a parametrized heating curve.
