There are different devices existing, 
we can categorize it in the following groups:

- Single phase inverters 
- Three phase symmetric inverters
- Three phase asymmetric inverters

All of them can be an "island inverter" i.e. they're able to start in blackstart mode and build their own grid.
Then we can tell or have to tell the inverter the grid characteristics: voltage and frequency
All of them can be able to do reactive power, 
 
- not every inverter is able to to reactive power

Context of active and reactive power:
	 
	(apparent power) * (cos phi) = (active power)
	(active power)² + (reactive power)² = (apparent power)²

	
================================================

General:

// Does not belong to battery inverter api, it is general for any device 
//public interface Device {
//
//	void start();
//	void stop();
//	
//	// E.g. Software version, device number... whatever...
//	String getDeviceInfo();
//	
//	State getState() // OFF, STARTING, RUNNING.....
//}
